# Top and bottom interfaces used for a SpecFEM2D binary GLL mesh model.
# This file defines interfaces for a single-layer 'internal mesh' model.
# Model dimensions are (NZ X NX) = (38 X 124) spectral elements.
# The model includes 3 PML absorbing boundary layers at ends and bottom.
# Nominal element size is 100 meters.
# Please ensure your Par_file parameters are consistent with these dimensions.
# NOTE: This file was generated by the adaptiveMesher utility.
#
# number of interfaces:
  2
#
# For each interface, we give the number of points and then x,z for each point.
#
# interface 1 (bottom of the mesh):
  2
       -300      -3800
      12100      -3800
# interface 2 (top surface):
  2
       -300          0
      12100          0
#
# for the one layer, the number of spectral elements in the vertical direction:
 38
