# Top and bottom interfaces used for a SpecFEM2D binary GLL mesh model. 
# This file defines interfaces for a single-layer 'internal mesh' model. 
# Model dimensions are (NZ X NX) = (35 X 118) spectral elements. 
# The model includes 0 PML absorbing boundary layers at ends and bottom.
# Nominal element size is 100 meters.
# Please ensure your Par_file parameters are consistent with these dimensions.
# NOTE: This file was generated by the adaptiveMesher utility. 
#   
# number of interfaces:
  2 
#   
# For each interface, we give the number of points and then x,z for each point. 
#   
# interface 1 (bottom of the mesh): 
  2
