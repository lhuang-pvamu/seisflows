Seisflows setup for Marmousi case with rectangular 92 X 30 mesh

SUPPLIED MODEL:

The "classic" Marmousi 2D acoustic case study has (X,Z) dimensions 9200 X 3000 m
 
The 'model_true' Vp velocity model supplied with Seisflows is in GLL format, 
and includes a thin water layer on top (about 17 m, close to zero). 
The mesh consists of 90 X 30 spectral elements, each rectangular in shape and
sampled by 5 X 5 GLL gridpoints.

The gll2npy script was used to generate a 455 X 148 grid of Vp values with
grid spacing of 20 m, forming a basis for subsequent model generation.

The adaptiveMesher utility was used to make a new mesh of 92 X 30 spectral 
elements, with both true and smoothed (span=51) initial models.
The new mesh was constructed to have rectangular elements.

Survey to be used for inversion has 91 shots spaced 100 m and 
receivers spaced 25 meters across the entire model.
